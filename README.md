# open890

![Elixir CI status](https://github.com/tonyc/open890/workflows/Test/badge.svg)

open890 is a web-based UI for the Kenwood TS-890S amateur radio, and features good usability, 
clean design, and high-speed bandscope/audio scope displays, among other features not available
either on the radio itself, or in the ARCP remote control software.

It is currently only designed to interface with the TS-890 via a LAN (or wifi) connection, and not
a USB/serial connection. It may work with the TS-990, as the command set is very similar, but is
currently untested.

## Installation from source

These instructions assume a basic knowledge of Linux/Unix and command-line tools.

open890 is currently supported under Linux, or Linux-like operating systems. You can also run it
in Windows 10 if you have [WSL](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10) installed - much of this project was written under WSL.

You will need Elixir (and thus, Erlang) and NodeJS installed, particularly if you are either
developing features for open890, or using a non-binary (e.g. source) release.

Using a tool like [asdf](https://asdf-vm.com/) is recommended
to manage the various versions of the development dependencies.

### Using asdf

  * [Install asdf](https://asdf-vm.com/#/core-manage-asdf?id=install)
  * Install erlang, elixir and nodeJS plugins

        asdf plugin add erlang https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf-erlang.git
        asdf plugin-add elixir https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf-elixir.git
        asdf plugin-add nodejs https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf-nodejs.git

  * At this point, Raspberry Pi users may need to install the following packages:
  
        sudo apt -y install autoconf libssl-dev libncurses5-dev
  
  * Install the specific versions listed in the `.tool-versions` file:
 
        bash -c '${ASDF_DATA_DIR:=$HOME/.asdf}/plugins/nodejs/bin/import-release-team-keyring'
        asdf install

  * The Erlang install will take a very long time on a Raspberry Pi. You may also see scary-looking messages during the Erlang install that says something like "fop is missing" or "documentation cannot be built" - this is OK.       
  * Once everything has installed, you should be able to run `elixir --version` and also `npm --version`
  
  * Clone this repository
  
  * Continue from [Config](#config)


## Binary releases

Binary releases are available from [releases](https://github.com/tonyc/open890/releases/).
They currently are only supported to run on 64-bit Ubuntu 20.04, although other modern Linux releases may work (or not).

The binary is a self-contained ELF executable that expands itself into `~/.cache/bakeware`

After downloading:

    chmod u+x open890
    ./open890

If you encounter an error related to shared libraries, etc, they _may_ be solved by installing the correct version,
although the correct packages may not be available in your OS distribution's package manager. 

If all else fails, install from source.

## Start your server:

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`. First-time users may need to answer `Y` to a couple prompts
  * Install Node.js dependencies with `npm install` inside the `assets` directory
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server` from the main directory.

Now you can visit [`http://localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.

## Stopping your server

Type `^c^c` (aka: ctrl-c twice)
